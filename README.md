## About the project:

**E-Store-Serverless** is a basic Serverless web application as a CRUD of the Web store with deals. 

## Technologies used on the project:
 
 - NodeJS
 - Angular 12
 - JSON
 - Bootstrap
 - auth0
 - karma
 - jasmine
 - typescript
 - CSS
 - HTML5

## Tech Stack: 
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) as Deployment Framework 
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the Frontend 
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) as cloud provider for following services : DynamoDB, Cloudwatch, Lambda, API Gateway, Cloudformation, S3, X-Ray, AWS SDK
- [Auth0](auth0.com)  as Authentication Framework 
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) for the Backend

## Prerequisites:
* <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/" target="_blank">Auth0 account</a>
* <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>
* Serverless 
   * Create a <a href="https://dashboard.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless account</a> user
   * Install the Serverless Frameworkâ€™s CLI  (up to VERSION=2.21.1). Refer to the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more help.
   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless@2.21.1
   serverless --version
   ```
   * Login and configure serverless to use the AWS credentials 
   ```bash
   # Login to your dashboard from the CLI. It will ask to open your browser and finish the process.
   serverless login
   # Configure serverless to use the AWS credentials to deploy the application
   # You need to have a pair of Access key (YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID and YOUR_SECRET_KEY) of an IAM user with Admin access permissions
   sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY --profile serverless
   ```
   * you need to edit the `environment.ts` file in the `frontend/environment` folder. This file configures your client application  and contains an API endpoint and Auth0      
     configuration:
   ```ts
   const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
   export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

   export const authConfig = {
   domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
   clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
   callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:4200/callback'
   }
   ```

## Getting Started:

### Go to [backend]  by running: 
```
cd backend
npm install
serverless deploy -v
```

### Go to [frontend] by running:
```
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

#### Angular Crud

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

#### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

Click on the "Choose Files":

![Alt text](images/import-collection-2.png?raw=true "Image 2")


Select a file to import:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-3.png?raw=true "Image 3")


Right click on the imported collection to set variables for the collection:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-4.png?raw=true "Image 4")

Provide variables for the collection (similarly to how this was done in the course):
